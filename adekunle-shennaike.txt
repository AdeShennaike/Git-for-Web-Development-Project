Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
    Inline will fll in the space spanning from left to right with as much content as you desire that can possibly fit. will not break the flow of content.
    Vs block which will use all the space spanning left to right for a specific amount of content. breaks the flow of content.
    an inline element only takes up as much space as it needs, it doesn't break anything after it to a new line but it cannot take a width or height.

    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 
    If it is seen on a different  device like a phone its gonna mess up.

    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 
    Use the display property to make it inline.

    4. Name 3 elements that are display block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
    block elements: <h>, <p>, <div>
    inline elements: <span>, <img>
    inline-block elements: <button>

    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, how do we make all elements respect the width we've given them? 
    The box model has three parts. The content, the padding, the border, then the margin (which is whats manipulated to make elements respect its width).
    the content is the center piece. then the space around that is the padding. and the surrounding area is the border. All the space outside of that is the margin.
